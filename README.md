This project presents the implementation and evaluation of set-membership improved
normalized subband adaptive filter (SM-INSAF) algorithms for acoustic echo cancellation
(AEC). Based on the concepts of the INSAF framework and the set-membership filtering
theory, the SM-INSAF and its smoothed variant (SSM-INSAF) are developed to enhance
steady-state performance and reduce computational complexity. Simulation results under
different echo path conditions (sparse and dispersive) demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms outperform traditional INSAF approaches in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
environments.
